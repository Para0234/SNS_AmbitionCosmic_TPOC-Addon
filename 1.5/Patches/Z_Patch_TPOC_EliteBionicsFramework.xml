	<!-- If you're looking at this file hoping to learn more about patches, you're in luck! I will leave a comment pretty much everywhere so you can understand what's going on here. -->
	<!-- Most of the comments are focused around the first PatchOperationAdd and the first PatchOperationReplace. -->
	<!-- I know it might look daunting, and it might look too complicated to bother to learn, but it's actually really simple once you understand how it works. I learned xpath in just a day myself and had a patch made and uploaded the very same day! -->
