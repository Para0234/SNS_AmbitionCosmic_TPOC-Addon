	Planned turrets (concepts):
	
	(GEN1) Light Cosmic Turret: A portable turret that shoots like a Cosmic Rifle. It has a short cooldown period and requires refurbishment.
	(GEN1) Perdition Light Cosmic Turret: A portable turret that shoots slower than a Cosmic Rifle, but doesn't have a cooldown period. It requires refurbishment.
	
	(GEN1) Cosmic Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that shoots like a Cosmic Rifle combined with a Minigun. It has a short cooldown period and requires occasional refurbishment. 
	(GEN1) Perdition Cosmic Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that shoots like a Cosmic Rifle. Slower than the Cosmic Turret but no cooldown period and requires occasional refurbishment.
	(GEN1.5) Eternal Cosmic Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that shoots like a Cosmic Rifle combined with a Minigun. It has a short cooldown period. It does NOT require refurbishment.
	(GEN1.5) Eternal Perdition Cosmic Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that shoots like a Cosmic Rifle. Slower than the Cosmic Turret but no cooldown period. It does NOT require refurbishment.
	
	(GEN1) Catalyst Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that shoots Cosmic Sniper rounds at a good rate. It shoots 1 bullet and then has a short cooldown. It does NOT require refurbishment.
	(GEN1.5) Perdition Catalyst Turret: A non-portable 2x2 turret that rapidly shoots Cosmic Sniper rounds. It shoots 1 bullet at a time. It requires constant Cosmic Catalyst Cell refueling. (1 Cat. Cell per shot)
	
	(GEN2) Automated Lance: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots Cosmic Lance rounds. It has a (relatively) long cooldown and only shoots 1 bullet at a time. It requires Cosmic Catalyst Cells (5 eaten per shot) to work.
	(GEN2) Deep Storage Automated Lance: An Automated Lance with 500 CC Cell capacity.
	(GEN2) Perdition Automated Lance: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots Cosmic Lance rounds relatively quickly. It shoots 1 bullet at a time. It requires Cosmic Catalyst Cells (5 eaten per shot) and Cosmic Matter (50 eaten per shot) as coolant. //This gets expensive real quick, but will probably be absurdly powerful against pretty much everything.
	(GEN2) Deep Storage Perdition Automated Lance: A Perdition Automated Lance with 500 CC cell capacity and 5000 CM capacity.
	(GEN2.5) Eternal Automated Lance: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots Cosmic Lance rounds. It does NOT require fuel.
	
	(GEN2.9) Engimatic Lance: A non-portable 3x3 Eternium-fueled 4x4 turret that shoots EXARCH rounds quickly. It requires Eternium (1:1) as fuel.
	
	(GEN3) Automated EXARCH: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots EXARCH rounds. It shoots quickly and shoots 1 bullet at a time. It requires Eternium (1 per 5 shots) as fuel.
	(GEN3.5) Eternal Automated EXARCH: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots EXARCH rounds. It does not require any fuel.
	
	(GEN4) Bastion of Stability: A non-portable 3x3 turret that shoots EXARCH rounds like a minigun, said rounds also explode. It does not have any specific cooldown period.

	<description>The ultimate defensive weapon, the Bastion of Stability can lay waste to any incoming hostiles with ease all by itself. Its only vulnerabilities is that it cannot hit anything beneath a mountain and something too close can cause it to hit itself.</description>
